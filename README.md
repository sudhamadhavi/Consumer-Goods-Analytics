# Consumer-Goods-Analytics(Ad-Hoc-Insights)

# Problem Statement :
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. 
They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. 
Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. 
Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

# Project Structure :
Imagine you're applying for the role of a junior data analyst at Atliq Hardwares. Here's what you need to do:
- Review the 'ad-hoc-requests.pdf' document, which contains 10 business questions that need answers.
- Run SQL queries to answer these questions using the provided data.

# Technical Implementation :
- Writing SQL queries using CTEs, RANK, JOINS, date functions, sub-queries, and numeric functions.
- Extracting and transforming data for analysis.
- Analyzing and interpreting data to gain insights.
- Generating reports to present findings.
